      <description>If you are using WampSharp with WAMPv1 support and want to update to WAMPv2 version (without updating the protocol to WAMPv2) please read the following notes:
 All classes of WampSharp that are specific for WAMPv1 implementation have moved to namespace WampSharp.V1 Since Fleck has been updated to a newer version, specifying a host name in the serverAddress of a DefaultWampHost isn&#39;t supported anymore. You need to specify an IP address.</description>

      <title>Server PubSub hosting (WAMPv1)</title>

      <description>WampSharp contains a Pub/Sub mechanism.
Declaring topics All WampSharp server-side topics are contained in a WampTopicContainer. This is a property of the DefaultWampHost (called TopicContainer).
There are two types of topics:
 Temporary topics - created automatically when a subscriber subscribes to them, deleted when no one is subscribed. Persistent topics - created once by the application, never deleted.  In order to subscribe to new created topics, the WampTopicContainer has a TopicCreated event.</description>

      <title>Server RPC hosting (WAMPv1)</title>

      <description>As you&#39;ve seen in The getting started tutorial, WampSharp allows you to host RPC services and consume them from a WAMP client.
Declaring RPC services In order to declare a RPC service, just place a [WampRpcMethod] attribute above a method you want to expose. You can place the attribute either on the implemented method itself, or on a method belonging to an interface the RPC service implements.
The WampRpcMethod receives a ProcUri in its constructor - that is used as an identifier for the WAMP method (used by a WAMP CALL request).</description>
