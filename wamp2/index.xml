It is available through the WampSharp.RawSocket NuGet package.
Router-side usage TcpListener implementation This is a standalone implementation which uses TcpListener. In order to use it, install the WampSharp.RawSocket NuGet package. Usage example:
IWampHost host = new WampHost(); RawSocketTransport transport = new RawSocketTransport(TcpListener.Create(8080)); host.RegisterTransport(transport, new JTokenJsonBinding()); ASP.NET Core implementation This is an implementation of the RawSocket protocol using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Connections.Abstractions package, which is part of Project Bedrock. This implementation is present in the package WampSharp.</description></item><item><title>WebSocket transports</title><link>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/router/transports/websocket/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2017 10:25:07 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/router/transports/websocket/</guid><description>This pages describes the currently available router side WebSockets transports for WampSharp.
WampSharp.Fleck A Fleck based transport. It is the default transport for WampSharp (DefaultWampHost uses it). Supports .NET Framework 4.0.
Usage:
WampHost host = new WampHost(); host.RegisterTransport(new FleckWebSocketTransport(&amp;#34;ws://127.0.0.1:8080/ws&amp;#34;), new JTokenJsonBinding(), new JTokenMsgpackBinding()); host.Open(); Or
WampHost host = new DefaultWampHost(&amp;#34;ws://127.0.0.1:8080/ws&amp;#34;); host.Open(); WampSharp.Vtortola A transport based on vtortola&amp;rsquo;s WebSocketListener. Supports permessage-deflate.
Usage:
WampHost host = new WampHost(); IWampTransport transport = new VtortolaWebSocketTransport (endpoint: new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.</description></item><item><title>Client-side authentication</title><link>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/client/client-side-authentication/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 00:16:09 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/client/client-side-authentication/</guid><description>Client-side authentication is supported. In order to use client authentication, you need to implement an interface named IWampClientAuthenticator. Then, pass it to CreateChannel/CreateJsonChannel/CreateMsgpackChannel overloads of DefaultChannelFactory. In IWampClientAuthenticator we supply the supported authentication methods and the authenticationid, these are passed in the HELLO message to the router (as details.authmethods, details.authid). We also implement Authenticate method, which sends an AUTHENTICATE message to the router upon CHALLENGE.
Example public class TicketAuthenticator : IWampClientAuthenticator { private static readonly string[] mAuthenticationMethods = { &amp;#34;ticket&amp;#34; }; private readonly IDictionary&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt; mTickets = new Dictionary&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;() { {&amp;#34;peter&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;magic_secret_1&amp;#34;}, {&amp;#34;joe&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;magic_secret_2&amp;#34;} }; private const string User = &amp;#34;peter&amp;#34;; public AuthenticationResponse Authenticate(string authmethod, ChallengeDetails extra) { if (authmethod == &amp;#34;ticket&amp;#34;) { Console.</description></item><item><title>Cookie based router-side authentication</title><link>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/router/cookie-based-router-side-authentication/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 00:16:09 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/router/cookie-based-router-side-authentication/</guid><description>It is possible to build authenticators that are cookie-based. In order to that, one needs to implement an interface named ICookieAuthenticatorFactory and pass it to DefaultWampAuthenticationHost&amp;rsquo;s constructor, (or to FleckAuthenticatedWebSocketTransport/VtortolaAuthenticatedWebSocketTransport constructors).
The interface consists of a single method named &amp;ldquo;CreateAuthenticator&amp;rdquo;, which receives as a parameter an ICookieProvider, that is an interface that allows to access client cookies for read-only.
The authenticator created by the &amp;ldquo;CreateAuthenticator&amp;rdquo; method will be passed to the IWampSessionAuthenticatorFactory passed to the (Default)WampAuthenticationHost as the transportAuthenticator parameter.</description></item><item><title>Getting started with Callee</title><link>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/roles/callee/getting-started-with-callee/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 00:16:09 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/roles/callee/getting-started-with-callee/</guid><description>Before you begin, see Getting started with WAMPv2 and create a WampChannel/WampHost your calleee will be registered to.

It is possible both to consume WAMP meta-api from a WampSharp client, and to expose it from a WampSharp router.
Exposing meta-api In order to expose meta-api, you can call an extension method of IWampHostedRealm, named &amp;ldquo;HostMetaApiService&amp;rdquo;. This method returns an IDisposable which you can dispose in order to unregister the meta-api service.
Note: it is important to call HostMetaApiService before hosting any other components (callees/subscribers), since otherwise the meta-api service isn&amp;rsquo;t be able to track components registered before it.</description></item><item><title>Raw Callee</title><link>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/roles/callee/raw-callee/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 00:16:09 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/roles/callee/raw-callee/</guid><description>WampSharp provides a lower level api that allows to deal with rpc operations as they are sent/received, which is called Raw callee.
Actually, the reflection based callee api is built above the Raw callee api.
In order to use the raw callee api, implement IWampRpcOperation. A IWampFormatter is passed to your methods in order to allow you to deserialize the method parameters. In order to return a result or an error, call the corresponding caller method.</description></item><item><title>Raw Caller</title><link>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/roles/caller/raw-caller/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 00:16:09 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/roles/caller/raw-caller/</guid><description>The callee proxy is the easiest way to consume WAMP caller capabilities, but it is limited to C# features. In some cases you might want to handle a RESULT message differently. For these cases, the Raw callback api exists.
In order to use raw callback api from a WampSharp client, create a class implementing IWampRawRpcOperationClientCallback. This class will be notified when a result arrives. Then create a new instance of your class, and access RpcCatalog property of WampChannel&amp;rsquo;s RealmProxy, then call Invoke of your desired method with desired parameters.</description></item><item><title>Raw Publisher</title><link>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/roles/publisher/raw-publisher/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 00:16:09 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/roles/publisher/raw-publisher/</guid><description>If you want to get feedbacks for publications, you can use publisher raw api. In order to use it in client side, access the RealmProxy of your WampChannel and then access its TopicContainer property in order to obtain a WampTopicProxy to your topic. Then call Publish with PUBLISH parameters.
In order to use it from router side: Obtain the realm by accessing the RealmContainer property of your WampHost, then access its TopicContainer property in order to access the topic by its uri, then call publish with desired parameters.</description></item><item><title>Raw Subscriber</title><link>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/roles/subscriber/raw-subscriber/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 00:16:09 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://wampsharp.net/wamp2/roles/subscriber/raw-subscriber/</guid><description>Like other roles, subscriber also has a raw version, which allows you treat EVENT messages as you like.
